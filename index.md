Hi! Welcome to my site. I am Shubham Chandak (शुभम चांडक), an applied scientist at Amazon working in the AWS S3 team. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2021 (and MS in 2018), advised by Prof. [Tsachy Weissman](http://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/). Before that I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (India) in 2016. I am interested in data compression, bioinformatics, DNA storage, information theory and machine learning.

**I am co-instructing a class on data compression (EE 274) at Stanford in Fall 2022. Check out more about this
on the [course website here](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/Fall22/).**

I practise Vipassana meditation. Vipassana is a non-sectarian meditation technique that aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation. Find out more [here](https://www.dhamma.org/).
