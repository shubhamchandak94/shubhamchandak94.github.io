Hi! Welcome to my site. I am Shubham Chandak (शुभम चांडक), a senior applied scientist at Amazon working in the AWS Annapurna ML team (previous in S3). I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2021 (and MS in 2018), advised by Prof. [Tsachy Weissman](http://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/). Before that I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (India) in 2016. I am interested in machine learning, data compression, bioinformatics, DNA storage and information theory.

I co-instructed a class on data compression (EE 274) at Stanford in Fall 2022 ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv_7iO_xlL0Jgc35Pqn7XP5VTQ5krLMOl)) and Fall 2023 ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPj4uhbgUAaEKwNNak8xgkz)). Check out the [course website](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/), the [lecture notes](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/) and [SCL](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library/), a pedagogical compression library.

I practise Vipassana meditation. Vipassana is a non-sectarian meditation technique that aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation. Find out more [here](https://www.dhamma.org/).
